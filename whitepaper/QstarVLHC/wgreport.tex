I look for a dijet resonance produced by an excited quark $q^*$
in a simulated sample corresponding to 3\,ab$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 100$\,TeV.  Using a cut and count analysis approach I
am able to explore $q^*$ masses up to 50\,TeV, corresponding to a
length scale of around 4\,am.

\section{Introduction}

At the new energy regime afforded by a $\sqrt{s} =100$\,TeV $pp$
collider (VLHC)~\cite{Ambrosio:2001ej}, I could search for possible
structure of the quarks of the standard model \cite{Baur:1989kv,
  Baur:1987ga, Harris:1996ct}.  The primary background for a signal of
this type is the QCD dijet production.

\section{Data and detector simulation}

I utilize \textsc{pythia}~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} and the CTEQ6L1
PDF's to genererate both background and signal events and provide
parton showering.  The center of mass energy of the $pp$ collisions is
100\,TeV.  I use the ``Snowmass'' detector%~\cite{SnowDet}
, based on
the Delphes~\cite{Delphes} detector simulation package, to simulate
the detector response.  The foreseen rate for ``pile-up'' $pp$
interactions is an average of 140 minimum bias interactions per bunch
crossing.  The integrated liminosity is expected to reach
3\,ab$^{-1}$.  During the production of the signal samples, I use the
convention $\Lambda = m_{q^*}$.  The cross-sections reported by
\textsc{pythia} for the considered processes are contained in
Table~\ref{tab:qstar_xsec}.  As in~\cite{Baur:1989kv} the branching
fraction to dijets is 85\%.  

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:qstar_xsec} Cross-sections for signal processes.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
$q^*$ mass & cross-sections (fb) \\
\hline
30\,TeV & 22.8 \\
40\,TeV & 0.986 \\
50\,TeV & $4.38\times 10^{-2}$ \\
60\,TeV & $2.22\times 10^{-3}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Analysis}

From the signal and background samples, I select the two jets with the largest
$p_\mathrm{T}$.  To reduce the relative contribution of the QCD dijet
production, I require that the jet $p_\mathrm{T} > 10$\,TeV and $|\eta
| < 1.0$.  I use the dijet invariant mass spectrum to separate the
signal and background components.  The mass spectrum for the
background and various signals is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:qstar_vlhc}(left).  

Because of the large cross-section for the QCD process, I parameterize
the spectral shape from a large sample of simulated events and scale
this shape to provide our background estimate.  The functional form
selected for the background is an exponential decay with an error
function turn-on at the low-mass end of the specturm.  The line-shapes
for the various signal hypotheses are parameterized by a Gaussian
distribution for the peak and a wide structure to capture poorly
reconstructed events.

Limits are derived using a simple counting method.  I select a signal
window corresponding to $\pm 2\sigma$ of the peaking component of the
signal.  Using the signal and background counts within the signal
window, I place an asymptotic 95\% CL upper limit on the
cross-section for a given $q^*$ mass.  In these limits I do not
include any systematic uncertainties.  Given the simplicity of the
analysis, degradations due to systematic uncertainties can be
compensated through more advanced analysis techniques.

  CL upperlimit on the cross-section of $q^*$ resonance as a function

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:qstar_vlhc}(right) shows the expected limit as a
function of $q^*$ mass.  I can expect to explore masses upto 50\,TeV
using the full 3\,ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of the the VLHC.
A reach of 50\,TeV would study substructure within quarks on the order
of 4\,am.
